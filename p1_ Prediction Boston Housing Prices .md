## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
You want to be the best real estate agent out there. In order to compete with other agents in your area, you decide to use machine learning. You are going to use various statistical analysis tools to build the best model to predict the value of a given house. Your task is to find the best price your client can sell their house at. The best guess from a model is one that best generalizes the data.
For this assignment your client has a house with the following feature set: [11.95, 0.00, 18.100, 0, 0.6590, 5.6090, 90.00, 1.385, 24, 680.0, 20.20, 332.09, 12.13]. To get started, use the example scikit implementation. You will have to modify the code slightly to get the file up and running.

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA EXPLORATION
Before diving deeper into data, one need to explore using some basic statistical tools. Like five-point summary that provides the information about the dataset being used. Thus, this section includes some exploration about the data.
* NUMBER OF DATA POINT 
* NUMBER OF FEATURES
* MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM HOUSING PRICES
* MEAN AND MEDIAN HOUSING PRICES
* STANDARD DEVIATION

## EVALUATION MODEL PERFORMANCE
Which measure of model performance is best to use for predicting Boston housing data and analyzing the error? Why do you think this measurement most appropriate? Why might the other measurements not be appropriate here? 
Why is it important to split the Boston housing data into training and testing data? What happens if you do not do this?
What does grid search do and why might you want to use it?
Why is cross validation useful and why might we use it with grid search?
